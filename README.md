# Reservation System — Frontend

This repository contains the React/Zustand UI for the Reservation System (Clausis Reserve) reservation system.

A modern React-based frontend for a reservation and venue management platform. The application supports customer browsing, venue and event discovery, organizer and owner portals, QR-based check-ins, and interactive venue mapping.

    CACHE[("Redis<br/>Read cache")]
    STRIPE["Stripe<br/>Payments, refunds"]
    SMTP["SMTP<br/>Email notifications"]
